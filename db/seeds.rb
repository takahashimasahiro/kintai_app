# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# user = User.new(id: 1,user_id: "kanrisya",email: "admin@example.com",name: "hoge",role: "owner",paid_holliday_count: 9,password: "password")
# user.save
